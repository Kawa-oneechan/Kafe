# Kafe

I originally tried to write a fighting game engine back in my VB6 days. The original attempt (?) dates back from October 2004 to May 2006 and was drawn entirely in GDI. The later, better attempt used DirectDraw and dates from June 2006 to August 2006.

Come May 2019, a certain online acquaintance and I discuss the *Firrhna Project* and how it could use a fighting game. I don't like Fighter Maker 95 nor MUGEN, and recalled that's why I made the original Kafe in the first place.

This project is an attempt to rewrite it in C# with Monogame, because the VB6 version utterly refuses to run.

The most important file from the old version is included as `mGame.bas`.
